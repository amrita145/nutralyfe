      <p class="sec3-txt2">Introducing Hydroxycitric Acid (HCA)</p>
      <div class="clearall"></div>	
        <p class="sec3-txt3">Why are scientists all over the world studying Garcinia Cambogia and the effects of HCA?  What is science so curious about? Research is focused on HCA extract from Garcinia Cambogia as a weight loss aid in two powerful ways.
</p>
    <p class="sec3-txt2 green">Helps Eliminate Fat</p>
    <div class="clearall"></div>
    <p class="sec3-txt3 helps-para">There is an enzyme in your body called Citrate Lyase that helps you turn your favorite snacks into fat. HCA aims to prevent this enzyme from producing more stored fat than you need. You could burn more tasty treats as fuel rather than store them.
</p>
    <div class="clearall"></div>
    <p class="sec3-txt2 green">Suppresses Appetite</p>
    <div class="clearall"></div>
    <p class="sec3-txt3 helps-para">Researchers are also encouraged by HCA’s ability to increase serotonin levels - a key to suppressing appetite.   Serotonin is a neurotransmitter in your brain that makes you feel good.  By increasing serotonin levels, HCA improves mood and suppresses emotional eating during stressful times.
